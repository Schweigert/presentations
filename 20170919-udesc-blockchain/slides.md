## The "Double-spending" problem

> Double-spending is the result of successfully spending some money more than once.

- A number of distributed systems had been proposed since 2007 to solve this problem;
- Bitcoin, using a proof-of-work system (Hashcash) on a distributed ledger of transactions, was proposed in 2009.

## It's just a database;

- A very specific one, though (**distributed ledger**);
- CAP Theorem:
  - ACID;
  - BASE.

## Decentralized, but trust is still needed

> While one of the most important features of blockchains is removing the need for trusted third parties, most people donâ€™t have the time or background to thoroughly evaluate the software, which means that trust is still needed: trust in the developers of the project, or someone else capable of evaluating the software.

## Not a jack-of-all-trades:

> Blockchain is not a general-purpose solution for everything. It should be considered as an enabler to creating new decentralized services and solving specific business problems (such as the double-spend problem in trustless P2P environments for the brilliant Bitcoin).
